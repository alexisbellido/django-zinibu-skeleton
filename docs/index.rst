Documentation for skeleton Django application used by the zinibu project.

-------------------
Using pip
-------------------

You should first switch to the virtual environment you will be using with pyvenv or virtualenv.

To install from the source using a version control system, git in this case, use --editable (-e):

  ``pip install -e git://github.com/user/django-zinibu-skeleton#egg=django-zinibu-skeleton``

Use django-zinibu-skeleton, what was defined with the #egg parameter, for uninstalling:

  ``pip uninstall django-zinibu-skeleton``

You can also install from the source path, which helps while developing the application while keeping it installed:

  ``pip install -e /home/user/django-zinibu-skeleton``

--editable is actually optional so you can:

  ``pip install /home/user/django-zinibu-skeleton``

When installing from a source path you may need to manually uninstall the package from your virtual environment. For a certain version of django-zinibu-skeleton (0.0.2a0) in a virtual environment called zinibu_dev, these commands should work:

  ``rm -rf ~/pyvenvs/zinibu_dev/lib/python3.4/site-packages/znbskeleton/``

  ``rm -rf ~/pyvenvs/zinibu_dev/lib/python3.4/site-packages/django_zinibu_skeleton-0.0.2a0-py3.4.egg-info/``

You can see what version of the module you're using and the path where it's coming from by going to the Python shell and running:

  ``import znbskeleton``

  ``print znbskeleton.VERSION``

  ``print znbskeleton.__file__``

You can see what packages are installed at any moment:

  ``pip freeze``

And you can uninstall the same way you did when using a source from version control:

  ``pip uninstall django-zinibu-skeleton``

Underscores should work too:

  ``pip uninstall django_zinibu_skeleton``

Install with pip and specify version with:

  ``pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi django-zinibu-skeleton==0.0.2a0``

Test the module from the Python shell as explained above. Make sure you are in a different directory to avoid using the module from the current directory instead of the virtual environment.
